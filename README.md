# AI Agent for Transcribing and Summarizing Video  
An agentic AI project that extracts audio from videos, transcribes it using Whisper, and summarizes the content using Python-based NLP techniques—all wrapped in an interactive Streamlit app.

## Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how to build an AI-powered agent that can:
- Extract audio from video files
- Transcribe speech to text using Whisper
- Summarize long transcripts into concise overviews
- Provide an interactive user interface via Streamlit

## What I Learned  
-  How to extract audio from video files using `ffmpeg`
-  How to transcribe audio using OpenAI’s Whisper model
-  How to implement text summarization using Python (e.g., `transformers`, or custom logic)
-  How to structure a Python project for clarity and scalability
-  How to build a user-friendly web app using Streamlit
